# Job Notes

### Personal Strategy
- Re-read these notes daily until the message has not settled in permanently.
- No emotions nor emotional reactions in relation to anything for that matter.
- Entertainment is emotion, thus do not entertain while working for the reason that this is an emotional action.
- Think before doing anything. Segment things into actions and processes and think before any two actions. Consider thinking as letting possibilities bubble up, the more of them you allow to appear the more variety of options you may choose from.

### Project Strategy
- Require an absolute totality of knowledge about the environment you are working in and on.
- If former is impossible require a totality of knowledge on a sub-problem you are working in and on.
- Priorities:
    - The first priority is maximizing Security. System security should be a top priority and a, if possibly not only probabilistic, but decidedly proveable, quality of any system you are working on.
    - The second priority is maximizing Usefulness. Systems are used and paid for exactly because they are useful whether it be for automatically regulating a high furnace or generating profit.
      - The pre-condition for this is that the System is not only safe but works.
      - The most important subfactor for this is Impact ðŸ’¥, meaning that the technology is "disruptive" and in essence exploits existing system inefficiences.
      - The second subfactor would be functional diversity in the sense that not only Impact is maximized for one specific set of inefficiencies (which can be exploited together) but as many as possible at the same time.
      - The third subfactor would be multiplicity and generalization in the sense that the simplest concepts are isolated and repeatedly applied to tackle above.
    - The third priority would be maximizing Optimization. Some systems heavily depend on optimization as their impact factor, but these are generally of lower worth than other non-optimization dependent high impact factor systems.
